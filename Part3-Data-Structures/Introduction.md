Sets are as fundamental to computer science as they are to mathematics. Whereas mathematical sets are unchanging, the sets manipulated by algorithms can grow, shrink, or otherwise change over time. We call such sets ***dynamic***. The next four chapters present some basic techniques for representing finite dynamic sets and manipulating them on a computer.

Algorithms may require several types of operations to be performed on sets. We call a dynamic set that supports these operations a ***dictionary***. Other algorithms require more complicated operations. The best way to implement a dynamic set depends upon the operations that you need to support.
